# Plant-Disease-Detector

Plant disease significantly impacts crop yields, leading to health issues, economic instability, and unpredictable agricultural outcomes. In collaboration with Data Science Student Society (DS3) and support from the University Machine Learning Research Platform (DSMLP), my team and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using PyTorch to accurately identify plant diseases from a comprehensive dataset of images featuring various plant species, annotated with labels for healthy and unhealthy conditions.

We leveraged PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, and Pandas for effective leaf image classification and disease detection, and utilized computer vision techniques and data loaders for efficient image processing. By reducing the training and validation loss across epochs and fine tuning our CNN parameters, our model achieved a 77% accuracy rate in classifying images of leaves from 14 plant species into 38 different plant disease categories.
